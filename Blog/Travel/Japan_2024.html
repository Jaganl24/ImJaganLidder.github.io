        <p>I still remember the day my friends and I discussed the idea of going on this trip. For so long, it had been on my bucket list as a must-visit destination. Japan seemed like the ultimate escape from the West, a region I had spent so much time in that I was due for a change of scenery.</p>
        <p>With all of us on different life paths, it felt as though the stars (and our wallets) had to align to make it happen. The allure of this island, however, was powerful enough to tug us across the Pacific if it needed to. It was ultimately up to us to make it happen, and thankfully, we did. </p>
        <p>The entire trip was three weeks. We visited Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, Nara, Himeji, Hiroshima, and Mount Fuji.</p>
        <h2 class="pb-2">Tokyo</h2>

        <p>The scale of Tokyo alone was beyond my comprehension. The city never seemed to end. Whether it was day or night, there were so many activities to do that were unique and enjoyable. Whether it was the bright lights of Akihabara or the busy streets of Shibuya, each ward had its own flavour. TeamLabs offered an interactive art experience like no other, and the streets of Ginza offered a glimpse into Tokyo’s luxurious offerings. Food was also plentiful and delectable. From automated sushi lines to world-class Ramen, Tokyo did not disappoint when it came to its culinary options. We were on a budget, so fine dining was not something we explored, but it did not hinder our experience whatsoever. </p>

        <p>We then took a bullet train from Tokyo to Kyoto. Check-in to our Airbnb was late, so upon our arrival, we decided to hike the Fushimi Inari Shrine. It proved to be a challenge with our bags, but we were more than up to the task.</p>

        <p>Part of Day 2 in Kyoto was spent in the famous Arashiyama Bamboo Forest. The soaring bamboo stalks seemed to have no end, and the variety of lush gardens decorated with stone sculptures in between made the area worth exploring. We also had the opportunity to take a boat ride on the Katsura River, which proved to be a peaceful experience as we were serenaded by a Japanese flute player.</p>

        <p> The rest of our time in Kyoto was primarily spent visiting temples and really taking in the city. As the spiritual center of Japan, I felt it was a good time to slow down from the fast pace of Tokyo and really sit with myself and meditate on the idea that I was really in Japan. Some of my favourite moments in Kyoto were spent by the Kamo River at night, eating Famichiki and drinking Sapporo from Family Mart. I also loved roaming the city's narrow passages after dark and soaking in its unique charm. </p>
        <h2 class="pb-2">Osaka</h2>

        <p> The stay in Osaka marked the longest stay in our trip. While rough around the edges, the Dotonbori area had the most to offer in terms of nightlife, variety of food and shopping boutiques, all in one central location. In stark contrast, areas like Umeda resembled a modern metropolis full of high rises and large shopping centers. Both being in such proximity to one another offered an experience that was unique in Japan, as the city of Osaka was comprised of two sides of the same coin, one dark and gritty and one upscale and modern. It also helped that it was in a central spot next to neighbouring cities like Nara, Himeji and Kobe, making day trips to neighbouring cities possible. </p>

        <p>I did most of my shopping at the multiple thrift stores here, which all offered unique pieces for reasonable prices. This ranged from polo button-ups to racing jackets, as you would expect from any thrift store. Osaka was also the city where I had my first bowl of Ichiran ramen. After a long wait in line, I had the opportunity to sit in a private stall and enjoy a bowl of the best ramen and Asahi beer. Other activities we did included watching the sunset on top of the Umeda Sky building, climbing the fully restored Osaka castle and taking a boat ride through the Dotonbori canal. This combination of experiences is what made my stay in Osaka my favourite. There was so much to offer in such proximity, and areas like Dotonbori, which buzzed at night, filled me with an energy that I never got during the rest of our stay.
</p>
        <h2 class="pb-2">Nara & Himeji</h2>
        <p> Our stay in Osaka also gave us time to explore the surrounding towns and get a feel for what the rest of Japan had to offer. </p>

        <p>Nara is known for its roaming deer and Tōdai-ji. Biscuits could be bought to feed the deer. They roamed in small packs throughout the town and were accustomed to the influx of tourists walking in their environment. Tōdai-ji housed one of the world's largest bronze statues of the Buddha Vairocana. Its size could not be understood as the statue stood 15m tall! Our time here also marked the first time it rained in Japan, which was much needed, as the heat was starting to take its toll. </p>

        <p> Himeji was primarily known for Himeji Castle. We were lucky enough to stumble upon a Japanese lady who gave us a free tour of the castle and its history. It was such experiences that helped us form a deeper connection with Japan’s rich history. </p>
        <h2 class="pb-2">Hiroshima</h2>

        <p> This was the experience that had the greatest impact on me during our stay. Visiting the city almost 80 years after the tragic bombing occurred was an eye-opening experience. We got to walk by the Atomic Bomb Dome, one of the few structures that was left standing after the bomb decimated the city of Hiroshima. It has been preserved and restored since and stands as a haunting reminder of what once was. The Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum depicted the events of August 6th, 1945, and the months after in a setting full of images, artworks, recovered artifacts, and stories of survivors of the bombing. The layout of the exhibition was chronological, walking us through life before, the immediate aftermath, and life today. It was hard to imagine a world where such a decision was seen as justified, but the people of Hiroshima have responded not with vengeance, but with a profound and unwavering call for peace.</p>
        <h2 class="pb-2">Mt.Fuji</h2>
        <div class="pb-1">
         <img loading="lazy" src="../Travel Images/IMG_8643.webp" alt="" class="mb-3 img-fit img-fluid">

        <p>We chose to end the trip at a relaxing all-inclusive Hotel/onsen in the Mt.Fuji area. The stay was brief but a much-needed break from our long adventures. Having a hot outdoor bath and comfortable beds was a nice change of pace compared to the Airbnbs we had spent the rest of our trip in. The sky was also clear enough for Mt.Fuji to make an appearance from our hotel room window.</p>
